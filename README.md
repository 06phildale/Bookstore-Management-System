# Bookstore Management System

## Objective

The Bookstore Management System project was designed to create a Python application that allows bookstore clerks to efficiently manage inventory. The system enables adding new books, updating existing records, deleting books, and searching the database for availability. Additionally, it demonstrates relational database management by linking books to authors and displaying complete book details.

### Skills Learned

- Designing and implementing a Python application with a command-line interface.  
- Creating and managing relational databases using SQLite.  
- Writing SQL queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
- Implementing data validation, error handling, and code modularity.  
- Developing user-friendly output for practical inventory management.
